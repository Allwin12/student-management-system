# student-management-system
A complete Django API project to add and manage schools and students using Django-Rest-Framework.

This project consists of the following two tables.

* Student
* School

School is the foreign key to the student table. Since this is a sample project I am using the default sqlite3 database 
for the database.

You can add/view/edit/delete students and schools.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

This will install all the required packages and libraries.
